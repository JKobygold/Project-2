        <h3>What is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?</h3>
        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness
            that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes
            COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during
            an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Can people in the U.S. get COVID-19?</h3>
            <p>Yes. COVID-19 is spreading from person to person in parts of
                the United States. Risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher
                for people who are close contacts of someone known to have
                COVID-19, for example healthcare workers, or household
                members. Other people at higher risk for infection are those
                who live in or have recently been in an area with ongoing spread
                of COVID-19. Learn more about places with ongoing spread at

            <h3>Have there been cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was
                reported on January 21, 2020. The current count of cases of
                COVID-19 in the United States is available on CDC’s webpage at

            <h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an
                animal source, but is now spreading from person to person.
                The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who
        are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)
        through respiratory droplets produced when an infected
        person coughs or sneezes. It also may be possible that a person
        can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
        the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
        possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main
        way the virus spreads. Learn what is known about the spread
        of newly emerged coronaviruses at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/

        <p>Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory
        illness with symptoms of
            <ul>
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>cough</li>

        <h3>How can I help protect myself?</h3>
        <p>People can help protect themselves from respiratory illness with
            everyday preventive actions.
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with
                    unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
                        seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>

        <h3>If you are sick, to keep from spreading respiratory illness
        to others, you should</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
                <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>

        <br>
        <h3>What should I do if I recently traveled from an area with
        ongoing spread of COVID-19?</h3>
        <p>If you have traveled from an affected area, there may be
        restrictions on your movements for up to 2 weeks. If you
        develop symptoms during that period (fever, cough, trouble
        breathing), seek medical advice. Call the office of your health
        care provider before you go, and tell them about your travel and
        your symptoms. They will give you instructions on how to get
        care without exposing other people to your illness. While sick,
        avoid contact with people, don’t go out and delay any travel to
        reduce the possibility of spreading illness to others.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Is there a vaccine?</h3>
        <p>There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The
        best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive
        actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and
        washing your hands often.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Is there a treatment?</h3>
        <p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
        People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help
        relieve symptoms.</p>
