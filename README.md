##### future releases
* as this is a group project there are items and nice-to-haves that were ultimately left off.  
    1) Trending items on a big box store, we tried to get APIkeys to various stores such as Walmart, Best-Buy, and Target but were unable to, perhaps related to the current events.
    
    2) The EmailAuthProvider configured to require the user to enter a display name (defaults to true).

    3) The EmailAuthProvider configured to allow user cross device sign-in, and enable OAuth.

    4) calm audio playlist that is user controlled.
